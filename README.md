# Node.js Practice: ES6, JSDoc, Modules, and File I/O

This repository contains exercises and solutions for practicing Node.js concepts including ES6 features, JSDoc annotations, module handling, and file system operations.

## üìå Exercises

### Exercise 1: File I/O Operations
- **Objective**: Work with synchronous and asynchronous file operations in Node.js.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a project and configure `package.json` for ES modules.
  - Install global modules (`nodemon`, `jsdoc`).
  - Fix missing `fs` import in `Student.js`.
  - Convert file read/write operations to async versions.

### Exercise 2: Immutable Duration Module
- **Objective**: Implement a `Duration` class to handle time operations.
- **Tasks**:
  - Complete the `Duration` class with constructors and static builder methods.
  - Add `toString`, `plus`, and `minus` methods.
  - Test the module by importing and using it in a main file.

### Exercise 3: Race Scores Management
- **Objective**: Create a module to manage race results with file persistence.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define `RaceResult` and `RaceResultsService` classes.
  - Implement methods to add, save, load, and query race results.
  - Use `fs` module for JSON file operations.
  - Test functionalities like retrieving participant times and computing totals.
